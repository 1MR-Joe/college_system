# College system
## problem statement
we need a system for our college, it should provide some functionalities
- for the student
  - roll and unroll courses from the list of available courses
  - make requests
  - get notifications (e.g. tuition fees, official holidays)
  - receive exams schedule
- for the professor
  - see courses he/she is teaching 
  - send notifications for the students
  - enter attendance
- for the administrators (e.g. head of staff, manager, principle)
  - assign available courses
  - force withdrawal for some courses for some students
  - modify attendance

- visit the link, or take a look at the pdf version in `/resources/diagrams` directory 

## steps
1. tackle entities, course management, authentication
2. 

## notes
- the student dashboard will be a template(e.x. a header and a sidebar) the mid-section content depends on the route 
- 

## assumptions
- until an admin can register professor and student, the register feature will be public
- will use auto-incremented semester_course_code until custom code becomes useful


## interfaces ??
- login form
